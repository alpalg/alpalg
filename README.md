# 👋 Hi, I’m Pavlo 
#  👀 I’m interested in:
  - Data engineering
  - Python, Rust, Scala, Haskell
  
# Some my recent thougths.
  - SQLite, Turso for zero networking(DB installed to virtual server along with app itself) may be quite good idea for some cases

  Please reach me out with "+gitdiscussion" email tag if you interested to talk about topics above.

# 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Data architecture and how to make data architecture to meet client needs

# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Projects that use Spark
  - Project in Rust (would be great if somehow related to big data)
