# 👋 Hi, I’m Pavlo 
#  👀 I’m interested in:
  - Data related techologies
  - Python for fast prototyping and automatisation of routine work
  - Rust for more solid and reliable things
  - Functional languages (Haskell, Scala, Elixir)
  
# Some my recent thougths.
  - What do you think, is it possible to have something like Orca language but for general purposes?
  - Are array languages underestimated or just very specific? Why we don't have such as a part of other languages, but maybe w/o glyphs?
  Please reach me out with "+gitdiscussion" email tag if you interested to talk about topics above.

# 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - I'm going to excellence my knowledge of AWS, think about certification.
  - Activele learning Rust language, just like it.

# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Custom VM with suport of GUI
  - Programming languages which idea somewhere in the middle between functional language and array language.
